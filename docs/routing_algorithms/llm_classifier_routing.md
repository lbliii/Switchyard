# LLM Classifier Routing

LLM classifier routing asks a classifier model to evaluate each request, then
sends the request to a `weak` or `strong` backend. Use it when routing should
depend on request content, tool use, context needs, or risk level instead of a
fixed traffic split.

The classifier runs before the selected backend. Low-confidence and abstained
results use the configured default tier. Classifier errors do the same when
`classifier_fail_open` is enabled, which is the default. The built-in two-tier
policies default to `strong`.

## Choose a policy

Set `profile_name` for the traffic you expect:

| `profile_name` | Use for | Default tier mapping |
|---|---|---|
| `general` | Mixed chat or API traffic | `simple` uses `weak`; all higher tiers use `strong`. |
| `coding_agent` | Claude Code, Codex, Cursor-style agents | `simple` and `medium` use `weak`; `complex` and `reasoning` use `strong`. Tool-planning turns can escalate. |
| `openclaw` | OpenClaw personal-assistant traffic | `simple` and `medium` use `weak`; `complex` and `reasoning` use `strong`. Tool orchestration and high-risk external actions can escalate. |

For coding-agent traffic, start with `profile_name: coding_agent`.

## Configure a classifier profile

Define the strong, weak, and classifier models as targets, then reference those
target IDs from an `llm-routing` profile:

```yaml
endpoints:
  openrouter:
    api_key: ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}
    base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

targets:
  strong:
    endpoint: openrouter
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    format: openai
  weak:
    endpoint: openrouter
    model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
    format: openai
  classifier:
    endpoint: openrouter
    model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
    format: openai

profiles:
  smart:
    type: llm-routing
    profile_name: coding_agent
    strong: strong
    weak: weak
    classifier: classifier
    fallback_target_on_evict: strong
    classifier_min_confidence: 0.6
    classifier_fail_open: true
    classifier_recent_turn_window: 4
```

The classifier target must use `format: openai`. Start the profile server with:

```bash
switchyard serve --config profiles.yaml --port 4000
```

The profile ID (`smart`) is the model ID clients select for classifier-based
routing. The target IDs remain directly selectable when a client needs to
bypass the classifier.

Try the profile with representative requests:

```bash
# Coding task: expected to use the strong tier.
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dummy" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"smart","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Plan and implement a multi-file API change."}],"max_tokens":200}'

# Simple question: expected to use the weak tier.
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dummy" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"smart","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is 2+2? Reply with just the number."}],"max_tokens":50}'
```

Treat these as smoke checks, not fixed test vectors: the classifier model and
prompt determine the verdict.

## Production observability

`classifier_fail_open: true` keeps traffic available when the classifier times
out, returns a bad status, hits an SSL failure, or emits unparseable JSON. The
client still receives HTTP 200 from the configured default tier, so production
deployments must alert on the fallback path rather than on client errors.

Switchyard exposes two first-class signals when fail-open is triggered:

- Prometheus counter:
  `switchyard_classifier_fail_open_triggered_total{reason="upstream_5xx"|"upstream_4xx"|"timeout"|"ssl"|"parse_error"|"low_confidence"|"other"}`
- HTTP response header: `x-switchyard-fallback: classifier_error`

Recommended alert:

```yaml
- alert: SwitchyardClassifierFailOpen
  expr: sum(rate(switchyard_classifier_fail_open_triggered_total[5m])) > 0.05
  for: 10m
  annotations:
    summary: Switchyard classifier failing; requests are falling back to the default tier
```

`/v1/routing/stats` still includes the lower-level
`classifier.total_errors` counter for debugging the classifier bucket.

## Useful options

| Option | Use it when |
|---|---|
| `classifier_min_confidence` | Low-confidence results should use `default_tier` instead of the classifier policy. |
| `classifier_fail_open` | Classifier errors should use `default_tier` rather than fail the client request. |
| `classifier_recent_turn_window` | The classifier needs more or less recent conversation and tool context. |
| `classifier_max_tokens` | You need to cap the classifier tool-call response. |
| `alignment_min_confidence` | A classifier recommendation should only raise the policy tier above this confidence. |
| `default_tier` | Abstain, low-confidence, and fail-open decisions should use a tier other than the default `strong`. |
| `tier_mapping` | The four classifier policy tiers need a custom mapping to `weak` or `strong`. |

For a self-hosted strong, weak, or classifier target, configure it like any
other OpenAI-compatible endpoint. See
[Self-hosted targets](overview.md#self-hosted-targets).

## Session affinity

LLM classifier routing supports optional session affinity through
`DeterministicRoutingConfig`. Set `session_affinity: true` to share one affinity
store between the classifier and tier selector. After any configured
`affinity_warmup_turns`, the first confident verdict pins the tier. Later turns
reuse that tier before classification, so they skip the classifier call;
abstain, low-confidence, missing-signal, and fail-open decisions do not pin.

The CLI currently exposes these fields on a `type: deterministic` entry in a
`routes:` bundle loaded with `--routing-profiles`. The Rust `llm-routing`
profile loaded by `switchyard serve --config` does not yet expose them. See
[Session Affinity](sticky_routing.md) for YAML and
[How session affinity composes](overview.md#how-session-affinity-composes) for
the interaction with routing decisions.

If the per-request classifier cost is too high, use
[Stage-Router Routing](stage_router_routing.md), which can route many turns from tool and
agent-progress signals without an extra classifier call.
